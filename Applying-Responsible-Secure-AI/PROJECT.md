Title: "Applying Responsible/Secure AI with Semantic Kernel"

"In this session I'm going to demonstrate how you can use Semantic Kernel middleware filters to properly handle prompt injection and PII detection in your apps with ease of use"

- Using the Prompt Renderization 

- Using the PII Detection sample with the Microsoft Presidio

- Think on an application that I can use kernel for content safety detection

- Use the Demo and make it work with the Azure AI Service.

- Prompt Injection Detection
- PII Detection
- Content Safety Detection
- Using a model behind the scenes to identify sentiment (for safety reasons)
